# INTRODUCTION:
Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that affects how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing social interaction and communication problems.Every person with autism, since autism is a spectrum disorder, has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways people with autism learn, think, and solve problems can range from highly qualified to severely disabled ones.This study aimed to examine the long-term risk of autism spectrum disorders ( ASD) in preterm and full-term born individuals using both observational tools and parental reports. 

## STEPS:
1) Load Dataset and import libraries as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
2) Exploratory Data Analysis
3) Clean the data and feature engineering
4) Data Visualization 
5) Statistical modelling
6) Accuracy
7) Create GUI for Questionnaire Survey

## DEPENDENCIES:
Pandas 
Sklearn 
Numpy
Tkinter
Random
Accuracy= (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)
